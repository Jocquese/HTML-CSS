<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">The Roadmap to Early Retirement</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Whether your goal is to retire at age 65 or 35, you need a plan. You have to know how much money you’ll need to have saved in order to retire when you want—and how much you’ll need to save each month to get there.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Step 1: Get Out of Debt and Finish Your Emergency Fund</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Debt is holding back millions of younger workers from investing for retirement. That’s why you have to get focused. Chop up those credit cards and attack your debt with everything you’ve got.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">After you become debt-free and before you start investing for retirement, it’s time to build up an emergency fund. When you have enough money in a savings account to cover 3–6 months of expenses, you won’t have to worry about a broken air conditioner or a flat tire derailing your investing plan.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Step 2: Invest 15% Into Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Here comes the fun part! Now you’re ready to start saving for retirement. Begin by saving 15% of your gross income every month in retirement plans like a 401(k) and a Roth IRA—and be sure to invest your retirement money in mutual funds with a great track record.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Step 3: Save for Your Kids’ College and Pay Off Your Mortgage Early</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">Have kids? If so, it’s time to start saving for their college fund. This is important because it’ll help give them a head start on covering college expenses (and put them on a path toward graduating debt-free).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">While you’re doing that, get intense about paying off your home early. This is a huge goal that’s going to give you momentum toward early retirement! Think about it: How much more money would you be able to save for retirement if you didn’t have a house payment? What could you do if you were completely debt-free with a paid-for house?</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">Step 4: Investing Beyond 15%—Max Out Your Retirement Accounts</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">Now that you’ve got your little darling’s college fund in place and a paid-for house, you can really start to make some headway on your early retirement goals. First, go back to your 401(k) and IRA and max out your contributions. For 2021, you can put up to $19,500 into your 401(k) and $6,000 into an IRA. That’s $25,500 combined.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">But remember: In most cases, you won’t be able to withdraw money from your 401(k) or IRA without facing an early withdrawal penalty until you hit age 59 1/2. For example, with a traditional 401(k), you’ll not only have to pay income taxes on the money you take out, but Uncle Sam will be taking another 10% on top of that. Not a good plan!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">Step 5: Build a Bridge Account—Open a Taxable Investment Account</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, open up a taxable investment account to serve as your bridge account.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white;">You can take out money anytime you like. There are no contribution limits. You can open an account through a brokerage firm and invest in mutual funds.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: white;">The one big drawback to these investments is that you pay taxes on any money your account earns. It’s a good idea to sit down with your investment professional to work through the numbers and set a goal for how much you need in your bridge account to achieve your retirement goals.</p>
