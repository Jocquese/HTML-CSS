<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 45px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px"> Key Lessons You Can Take Away From The F.I.R.E.</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">1. Start Dreaming and Planning for Retirement</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">The best thing about the F.I.R.E. movement is that it’s getting you to start thinking about retirement—especially since less than half (41%) of Americans have tried to figure out their retirement savings needs. That’s like trying to aim for a target with a blindfold on. Define what you want your retirement to look like and make a plan to get there.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">2. Find Ways to Keep Your Expenses Low</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">F.I.R.E. followers take the time to look at where their money is going. They define wants and needs and cut out any spending that doesn’t make sense for them. They get on a budget and stick to it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">Saving a few dollars here and there really adds up over time. And that’s exactly what will help you make serious progress toward your goals.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">3. Look for Ways to Boost Your Income</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px">There’s no way around it. If you want to retire early—or really early—you have to get creative about finding ways to make extra cash.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white">Maybe you’re on a career path that’ll lead to that six-figure salary. Or maybe you’ve got a side hustle that you’re turning into a small business on nights and weekends. It could mean delivering pizzas for a while or saving up to buy a rental property.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white">Whatever that looks like for you, additional income will play a huge role in helping you take a step back from the workforce and enjoy an early retirement.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 40px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white">4. Make Saving and Investing a Priority</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white">If you want to retire early, you have to save and invest. There are no ifs, ands or buts about it. That’s why folks in the F.I.R.E. movement are radical about throwing huge chunks of their income toward their retirement.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; color: white">Maybe saving 50% sounds like too much for you right now. (That’s a lot for most of us.) And that’s okay! But we all have to start somewhere. That’s why we recommend you start by investing 15% of your income into retirement savings after you’ve paid off all your consumer debt and saved up 3–6 months of expenses in a fully funded emergency fund.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-size: 20px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: white">The key is to get into a regular habit of saving and investing every single month. When you do that, time and compound interest work for you instead of against you.</p>
